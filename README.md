# [xpcoffee.github.io](https://xpcoffee.github.io/)

My personal site for publishing notes. This runs on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for convenience, but I don't consider it a blog (no dates, just categorized ideas).


## Development

1) Pull down the repo

2) Install the dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

3) Start a local dev server

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Troubleshooting

 - Remove `Gemfile.lock` if you have issues with bundle versions locally
