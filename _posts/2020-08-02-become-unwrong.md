You could think of evolution and/or progress as the process of becoming less and less wrong. The less wrong you are, the better you fare.

The most advanced form of evolution is the ability of an individual to self-correct. For this to be effective, one needs to consciously acknowledge that you will often be wrong and that one needs to actively seek to constantly tweak their own behaviour to adapt to new information if they are to improve.
