Composition is a core topic when dealing with complex systems. In this document we'll briefly go through why we should care about composition and how we can use the mathematical concept of a monoid to help us design and build systems that enable composition.

## Composition

Composition is the idea that the results from solving problems can be combined into solutions for more complex problems. It is key to allowing us to build, maintain and improve complex systems. It is used heavily in engineering software systems; an understanding of techniques that enable composition is important to ensure that you build your software such that it can easily be understood, extended, and re-used.

There are multiple ways to approach composition. One approach is to do it mathematically: by defining a system of rules that work together to _guarantee_ composability. Even then, many mathematical systems enable composability. In this discussion, we'll be taking a look at one mathematical system in particular that is useful to use when programming: monoids.

## Monoids

"Monoid" is the name of a mathematical concept. I like to think of this concept as a system. That system is made up of the following parts: a grouping of items that can be composed; an operation that you can use to compose these items and some rules that both the items and the operation need to follow so that the system has useful properties. What I want to do here is to help you gain an intuitive understanding of this system by building it up step by step and illustrating how the rules of the system give us useful properties. We'll do with the help of some LEGO bricks.

So, we have a set of items that we want to compose together:

To start with, we need some operation that can compose two elements. For this discussion, we'll say that our operation takes two blocks and clips the first block on top of the second block. This operation is called **the monoidal product** and we can use the symbol **⊗** to help us write down what we're doing e.g. `A ⊗ B = C`

Take a look at the items themselves. Notice how the LEGO blocks share attributes that allow them to be composed together: they have studs on the top and a structure on the bottom that can clip onto studs. To phrase it slightly differently, these specific LEGO bricks are part of the larger <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A set is the mathematical term for a group of items that share properties.">**set**</span> of LEGO blocks that have studs at the top and the ability to clip onto studs at the bottom.

Now take a look at the result `C`. It too is part of the set: it has studs at the top and could also clip to studs at the bottom. This is really important: the resulting item of our operation (which takes two items in a set) is also an item in the set. Because it's in the set, we could also perform our operation on this result to get further composition. This property conceptually allows us to keep composing items together infinitely.

We now have the core of a system that allows composability, but we need to define some more rules that help make this system easy to work with.

The first of these is that we want to be able to perform compositions in any order. The picture below shows how two different composition orders for `A ⊗ B ⊗ C ⊗ D` result in the same end composition.

Why is this a useful property to have in our system? It allows us to break up work. For example: if you have multiple people helping you build `(A ⊗ B) ⊗ (C ⊗ D)`, you can have person 1 do `(A ⊗ B)`, person 2 can do `(C ⊗ D)` and person 3 can take the results from person 1 and person 2 and compose them together into the final result. This is the key principle behind assembly lines in factories and parallel processing in software systems. This property of not caring for which operation is performed first is called **associativity**.

An important note here that the "position" of the items still makes a difference: `A ⊗ B` is not the same as `B ⊗ A`. The above is about the order in which you perform the monoidal product.

> <small>Second condition for a monoid: the monoidal product must be **associative**.</small>

The last thing we need to consider is that what we're building is a mathematical system. Mathematical systems, both in pure-maths and when part of software systems, don't know the exact data/information they will be working with ahead of time. In the case of composability, we won't know the number of items we'll need to compose together ahead of time. So our system needs to be able to handle any number of items. How do we handle the case where we're given _a single item_ given that we've built a system on top of the monoidal product, which composes _two_ items together?

Here's where our example with LEGO blocks breaks down a bit. In real life, if we're given a single block we know that we don't need to do anything; there's nothing to attach that block to so we don't even try to apply the operation. In many situations - software processes in particular - we don't get to make that choice: we _have_ to run the operation every time the system is given something. The mathematical solution around this is rather sneaky and seems almost petty. We just _invent_ an item in the set and we _define it_ so that it doesn't do anything if it is used in the monoidal product. We call this item the **identity** and I'll use the symbol `i` for simplicity here (though `e` is often used as the symbol most often). With the identity we have `A ⊗ i = A` and `i ⊗ A = A`.

Here are some examples of identities that exist in arithmetic:

-   If we take the operation `+`, 0 is our identity: `4 + 0 = 4` and `0 + 4 = 4`
-   If we take the operation `*`, 1 is our identity: `7 * 1 = 7` and `1 * 7 = 7`

The identity also helps us deal with another case: the one where we're asked to compose an empty list of items. In this case, we can fall back to running the operation on two identities: `i ⊗ i = i`

> <small>Third condition for a monoid: the set we're using in our monoid must have an **identity** which, when used with another item in the monoidal product will result in the other item.</small>

And that's it. We have three conditions that give us a mathematical system that we can use and which mathematically guarantees composition:

1. There is a **monoidal product** that **takes two items of a set** and **returns an item in the same set**.
2. The monoidal product must be **associative**.
3. There is an **identity** in the set which, when used with another item in the monoidal product, will result in the other item.

So what do monoids look like in practice? Ironically, our LEGO blocks example is not a monoid: we saw that this system doesn't have an identity . There are several monoids in arithmetics: the set of real numbers, the monoidal product `+` and the identity `0` form a monoid; the set of real numbers, the monoidal product `*` and the identity `1` also form a monoid. We can also design them when writing software.

## Example monoid in code

Let's design a monoid that allows us to combine wishlists of stuff that our loved ones want.

```javascript
/**
 * We define a set of items with similar attributes that we want to compose:
 *
 * @typedef { { type: "normal" | "identity"; totalCost: number; items: string[]; } } Wishlist
 *
 * Note that we've given us a way to determine the identity as part of this set.
 */

/**
 * Convenience function for the identity
 * @returns {Wishlist} the identity
 */
function getIdentity() {
    return { type: "identity", totalCost: 0, items: [] };
}

/**
 * Our monoidal product
 * @param {Wishlist} wishlistA
 * @param {Wishlist} wishlistB
 */
function combineWishlists(wishlistA, wishlistB) {
    // We force our identity to have no effect
    if (wishlistA.type === "identity") {
        return { ...wishlistB };
    }

    if (wishlistB.type === "identity") {
        return { ...wishlistA };
    }

    return {
        type: "normal",
        totalCost: wishlistA.totalCost + wishlistB.totalCost,
        items: [...wishlistA.items, ...wishlistB.items],
    };
}

// We then write some tests that will ensure that this is actually a monoid
const assert = require("assert");

(function testAssociativity() {
    const wishlistA = { type: "normal", totalCost: 10, items: ["foo", "bar"] };
    const wishlistB = { type: "normal", totalCost: 200, items: ["baz"] };
    const wishlistC = { type: "normal", totalCost: 15, items: ["qux", "bar"] };

    // test (A x B) x C is the same as A x (B x C)
    const resultA = combineWishlists(wishlistA, combineWishlists(wishlistB, wishlistC));
    const resultB = combineWishlists(combineWishlists(wishlistA, wishlistB), wishlistC);
    assert.deepStrictEqual(resultA, resultB, "The monoidal product is not associative.");

    // sanity check for the actual values (should likely be tested in its own tests)
    assert.deepStrictEqual({ type: "normal", totalCost: 225, items: ["foo", "bar", "baz", "qux", "bar"] }, resultA);
})();

(function testIdentity() {
    const wishlistA = { type: "normal", totalCost: 10, items: ["foo", "bar"] };

    const oneWay = combineWishlists(wishlistA, getIdentity());
    assert.deepStrictEqual(
        oneWay,
        wishlistA,
        "The monoidal product with the identity in the second argument does not return the first argument"
    );

    const otherWay = combineWishlists(getIdentity(), wishlistA);
    assert.deepStrictEqual(
        otherWay,
        wishlistA,
        "The monoidal product with the identity in the first argument does not return the second argument"
    );

    const identities = combineWishlists(getIdentity(), getIdentity());
    assert.deepStrictEqual(
        identities,
        getIdentity(),
        "The monoidal product on identities does not result in an identity"
    );
})();
```

Now that we've defined our monoid, let's use it.

```javascript
function getFamilyWishlist() {
    const wishlistDad = {
        type: "normal",
        totalCost: 100,
        items: ["Running shoes"],
    };

    const wishlistBro = {
        type: "normal",
        totalCost: 300,
        items: ["Concert tickets", "Video game subscription"],
    };

    /**
     * @type {Wishlist[]}
     */
    const individualLists = [wishlistDad, wishlistBro];

    /**
     * Compose all the wishlists together using reduce.
     *
     * What will happen in the reduce:
     * step1: compose identity and wishlistDad
     * step2: compose result of step1 and wishlistBro
     */
    const initialValueForOurComposition = getIdentity();
    const familyWishlist = individualLists.reduce(
        (wishlistComposition, wishlistToAddToComposition) =>
            combineWishlists(wishlistComposition, wishlistToAddToComposition),
        initialValueForOurComposition
    );

    console.log(familyWishlist);
    // Output:
    // {
    //   type: 'normal',
    //   totalCost: 400,
    //   items: [ 'Running shoes', 'Concert tickets', 'Video game subscription' ]
    // }

    return familyWishlist;
}

function getFriendsWishlist() {
    const wishlistBob = {
        type: "normal",
        totalCost: 50,
        items: ["Chef knife"],
    };

    const wishlistJen = {
        type: "normal",
        totalCost: 25,
        items: ["Sci-fi novel"],
    };

    // Terser version of the functionality in the getFamilyWishlist function
    return [wishlistBob, wishlistJen].reduce(combineWishlists, getIdentity());
}

// Compose wishlists for family and friends together
// Note: you could run getFamilyWishlist() and getFriendsWishlist() in parallel threads
const wishlistFinal = combineWishlists(getFamilyWishlist(), getFriendsWishlist());
console.log(wishlistFinal);

// Output:
// {
//   type: 'normal',
//   totalCost: 475,
//   items: [
//     'Running shoes',
//     'Concert tickets',
//     'Video game subscription',
//     'Chef knife',
//     'Sci-fi novel'
//   ]
// }
```

## Closing out

Let's recap what we've discussed before closing out.

A monoid is a mathematical system where we have: a set; a monoidal product that can compose items in that set together, that returns an item that is also in the set and that is associative; an identity in the set that we can use in the monoidal product when we need to apply it on a single item or an empty list. The properties of monoids guarantee that we can infinitely compose items together and this composition can be done in parallel. In software, we can design monoids around the classes we need to work with and take advantage of these properties.
