This page is meant to give a high-level overview of what they are and how they can be useful in the context of programming. 
It starts with a brief overview of sets before explaining exactly what monoids are and how they can be put to use.

**TLDR - Monoids are a mathematical concept (specifically they're a type of set) that you can use to structure code to ensure composition and extensibility in your code.**

## What are sets? Why is it useful to think in sets?

A `set` (the mathematical concept, not the data-structure) is simply a collection of items that share one or more characteristics. Items of a set are also called `element`s of the set. Working with sets is useful: they give you information that you can use to your advantage. Below are some examples:

| Example set                   | Characteristics shared by elements of the set | How could the properties of the set be useful?                                           |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| natural numbers               | they are all integers greater than 0          | you can divide them without worrying about dividing by 0                                 |
| the User objects in a program | they represent users that can use the program | if you count the objects, we can determine how many users are using the program          |
| your biological family        | genetic information                           | genetic information from your family could reveal health issues that you may be prone to |

In many circumstances, we can go further than identify sets that already exist: it is possible to ***design* sets that have properties that we want**.

## What are monoids?

A monoid is _a type of set **and** a function_ with properties that ensure the elements of a set can be composed. A set is a monoid if it obeys the properties below:

#### 1 ) There is a <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="we call a function that take 2 arguments and produce one output a 'bifunction'">function that takes 2 elements</span> of the set and which produces another element in the set

This function is called <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="It doesn't have to be a product - it's just a name">**the monoidal product**</span>; it is often given the symbol **⊗**.

> *e.g. for natural numbers:  
> this works if ⊗ is `add` or `multiply`: they will both always result in a natural number  
> `subract` won't work (we can get negatives) and neither will `divide` (which can result in decimals)*

#### 2) The monoidal product can be applied between elements in any order

> *e.g. for natural numbers:  
> this works if ⊗ is `add` or `multiply`: 1 + (2 + 3) = (1 + 2) + 3 = 6 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2 * 3) * 3 = 2 * (3 * 3) = 18*

*Mathematically, this kind of behaviour is called "associativity".*

#### 3) There is an element of the set that makes the monoidal product passive

This special element is called the **identity**. If the identity is one of the two arguments of the monoidal product, the monoidal product will return the _other_ element.

>   *e.g. for natural numbers  
> if ⊗ is `multiply`: **1** is the identity. Multiplying a number with 1 always leaves the number unchanged.   
6 * 1 = 6   
> if ⊗ is `add`: there is no identity. Although **0** does what we want (0 + 6 = 6), 0 is not a natural number.  
> Because it fails this condition, natural numbers with ⊗ being `add` is **not a monoid***

#### Example monoid 

From the examples in this section, we saw that **the set of natural numbers with ⊗ as `multiply`** is a monoid, because it satisfied every condition.


## Why are monoids useful?

To illustrate the power/usefulness of monoids, we'll invent a monoidal set of shopping lists where ⊗ is the `or()` operation.

Without writing all of the code for this set, here's the behaviour we expect from the code.

```typescript
// === our monoidal product must take 2 lists and return a filter ===
function or(listA: ShoppingList, listB: ShoppingList): ShoppingList

// === our monoidal product must be associative ===
or(or(listA, listB), listC) === or(listA, or(listB, listC)) // true

// === we need an identity filter ===
const identityList: ShoppingList { /*...*/ }  // the identity is defined somewhere
or(identityList, listA) === listA // true
or(listA, identityList) === listA // true
```

### Composability 

The main boon that monoids give us is the ability to compose elements of our sets i.e. using small, simple blocks to build up larger, complex systems.

First of all, we know that we can **combine any two** `Filter` objects together using monoidal product. 

```typescript
const wishlist: ShoppingList = ... 
const groceries: ShoppingList = ... 
const thingsToBuy: ShoppingList = or(groceries, wishlist);
```

We also know that we will get back an element that is still in the set, so we can **chain the result indefinitely**.
The identity allows you to get started with one item.

```typescript
// notice how the complex Christmas list is composed of smaller lists
const christmasList: ShoppingList = or(or(or(or(identityList, myWishlist), momWishlist), dadWishlist), sisterWishlist)
```

Finally, because the product is associative, we can **break up and/or parallelize** the work to combinine elements of the set.
This can be important when the monoidal product is expensive or when there a large amount of elements to combine.  

```typescript
// in thread #1
const romanticShopping: ShoppingList = or(travelItems, flowersHeLikes) 

// in thread #2
const kidsShopping: ShoppingList = or(toys, schoolSupplies)

// combine the results inthread #3
const thingsToBuy: ShoppingList = or(romanticShopping, kidsShopping) 
```

### Extensibility

The composability that monoids provide is also good for extension. 
New elements can be added without modifying any of the existing elements and new elements are guaranteed to be composable with existing ones.

```typescript
// before
const firstList: ShoppingList = ...
const secondList: ShoppingList = ...

const result = or(firstList, secondList);

// after
const firstList: ShoppingList = ...
const secondList: ShoppingList = ...
const thirdList: ShoppingList = ... // easy to add

const result = or(
  or(firstList, secondList), 
  thirdList // immediately works with other filters
  );
```
