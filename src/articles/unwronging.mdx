**TLDR** The fastest way to correct issues/biases in society as a whole is to have individuals who actively seek to course-correct themselves.

<Card heading="Unwronging">
  <p className="text-sm">
    <i>verb</i>
  </p>
  <p>The conscious and systematic act of becoming less and less wrong.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Similar:</b>
    <i> improving, progressing, evolving, learning, adapting</i>
  </p>
</Card>

<p>
  Yeah, I made up that definition. But I think it conveys what I want to
  communicate.
</p>

This is a thought exercise for how we correct/adjust our positions as a society. Starting with
what helps us course-correct in the long-term and stepping through successively faster mechanisms.

My takeaway that the individual ability to self-correct is the quickest way for us as a whole to get better.

This requires us to consciously and systematically:

1. acknowledge that we will often be wrong
1. look for feedback and new information to understand when we are likely to wrong
1. tweak our behaviour according to new information
