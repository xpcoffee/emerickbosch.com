<p>Yes, I made that word up. But it conveys what I need it to.</p>

This is a thought exercise for how we _unwrong_ as a society. Starting with
biology/natural-selection and working towards the individual.

My takeaway from this exercise is that the individual ability to self-correct
is the quickest way for us as a whole to get better.

This requires us to consciously and systematically:

1. acknowledge that we will often be wrong
1. look for feedback and new information to understand when we are likely to wrong
1. tweak our behaviour according to new information

In short: the way to make society better is, first-and-foremost, to make ourselves better.
