The key concepts here are:

1. You can improve yourself to lead a fuller, happier life.
1. Self improvement requires
   conscious, active effort.

Working to this, these tenets help me actively think through situations with the goal of maximizing genuinely empathy, productivity, and skill and knowledge.
These are aimed at my personal strengths and weaknesses; I don't expect others to follow similar ones as they definitely won't work for everyone.
Like any set of tenets, these will change and get updated as I grow.

<h3>One | Don't be a dick</h3>

I resonate with Wheaton's Law. Start by assuming others
have good intentions even if their intentions are different from yours. Frame your
perspective to work with, not against/through/around them.

<h3>Two | You are ignorant</h3>

We have incomplete information. Acknowledge this as a constant and actively look
for and consider new information.

<h3>Three | Team success is individual success</h3>

We can't achieve our goals alone, so don't let others fail in their tasks. Be an
owner of your team's goals not just your individual tasks.

<h3>Four | Externalize</h3>

Saying something is more valuable than keeping quiet. You may be the only one that
thought of it. Someone else may not raise the point you want to talk about. If you're
uncomfortable with a decision / in a bad mood / disappointed, raise it.

<h3>Five | Ask, don't tell</h3>

Telling people about the way things are/should be can end a conversation prematurely,
especially if you have some convincing reasons for having that position. This can
take agency away from others who may have stepped up. It also cuts off an opportunity
for you to have heard other opinions, which may have influenced your position for
the better. Asking questions can allow you to raise your thoughts without imposing
them on others.
