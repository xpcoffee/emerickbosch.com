This entire section builds off of two concepts which are important to state explicitly: Firstly,
you can improve yourself to lead a fuller, happier life. Self improvement requires
conscious, active effort.

The way I try to consciously get better starts with writing down what I want to strive towards and what I strongly resonate with. I then turn those thoughts into a list of tenets which evolves as I grow.

<span className="text-sm quicksand">
  This specific list is aimed at my personal strengths and weaknesses. I don't
  expect others to follow the same principles, this is just what's worked the
  best for me so far.

<Card heading="People over _">

**Life is richer alongside others.** Don't be a dick to them. Enjoy their company. Learn from them.

**Most are striving for better.** Start by assuming others
have good intentions even if their intentions are different from yours. Frame your
perspective to work with, not against/through/around them.

<Card heading="Learning over correctness">

**We have incomplete information.** Acknowledge this as a constant and actively look
for, and genuinely consider, new information.

**You only get better by being wrong.** Try to fail small and within a controlled environment, and try to fail frequently.

</Card>

<Card heading="Team progress over individual ambition">

**Great things can't be achieved alone.** Primarily driving the collective goal is more valuable than focusing on individual achievements.

**Teams are made of individuals.** Care about the individuals if you want the team to flourish.

</Card>

<Card heading="Authenticity over consensus">

**Saying something is more valuable than keeping quiet.** You may be the only one that
thought of it. Someone else may not raise the point you want to talk about. If you're
uncomfortable with a decision / in a bad mood / disappointed, raise it.

**Your strengths are differences by definition.** Don't hide them, play to them.

**Strong feelings are legitimate.** Acknowledge them and make plans to accommodate them.
