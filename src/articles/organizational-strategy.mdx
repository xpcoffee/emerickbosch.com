**What does this article answer?**
What are the basic blocks needed to operate?

**Why do I want to write this?**
To have a clear model for myself, so I can talk about this with others and set expectations with a leadership team.

**Rough idea for contents**
Work backwards from purpose:

- Purpose: Why are we doing this?
- Flavour (needs better name): How are we doing this in a unique way?
- Tenets: How do we make tough decisions consciously to make the above happen?
- Domain: How are we conceptually structuring ourselves as a product?
- Strategy: How do we think we can make this happen practically?
- Organisation: How are we conceptually structuring ourselves to collaborate when we need to?

Stop at organization; from here teams should self-organize, but have a scaffold of how they fit into the whole.
Also organization is what affects architecture; you still have control over this - see also Conway's Law.
