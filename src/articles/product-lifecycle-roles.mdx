Recently I've come across misalignments in expectations of job roles and, more importantly, confusion around how to fix this situation.
Businesses which rely on the output of multiple disciplines need to have a well understood division of labour in order to perform effectively, so it is critical to have a method to re-align our understanding of job roles.
Here, I lay out an approach to do this which I find to be effective at driving alignment, low-cost to apply, and which can be iterated on to match the needs of different spaces.

The approach is based on 3 fundamental steps:

1. **Identify** the high-level tasks that need to be delivered.
1. **Break-down** each of these high-level tasks into smaller tasks that a single role could drive independently.
1. **Assign** these tasks to roles. \*_This is the hardest part. I have some thoughts to help with this further down._

There's nothing particularly revolutionary here.
The strengths I've found in this approach is that it forces you to to collaboratively express a vision of what needs to get done, clearly highlights gaps and conflicts, and creates a record that allows you to iterate on it.

Let's go through each step in more detail, and then we'll apply the steps in the context of some examples to make this tangible.

# Steps

## 1) Identify high-level tasks

The intent of the first step is to first align on the work that all roles need to drive.
We want to establish common-ground between everyone about the big-picture of what work needs to get done, and that this is a collaborative exercise.

Come up with a **rough** set of **necessary**, **high-level** tasks. A list of tasks on a single notebook page is good-enough to share understanding, and to move onto the next step.

**Do...**

- Enumerate all the high level tasks that are critical to success.
- Take note if there is a fundamental misunderstanding of high-level tasks. If you're misaligned at this high-level, then you've likely found a root-cause of problems. Consider pulling in your leadership team to help establish the big picture if this is the case.
- Make use of what already exists. If you're aligning on responsibilities to deliver a product, and you already have a product-delivery-life-cycle that you use, then start with this.

**Do not...**

- Enumerate tasks that are not critical to success. We want to remove blockers for the team; I don't think this exercise would be effective if you try to align on every possible task.
- Consider roles yet we only start talking about who does what in step 3 - this is about aligning on what needs to be done overall.

## 2) Break-down tasks

## 3) Assign tasks to roles

# Examples

I work in software development so these examples come from that context, but I think these could still be illustrative to your context.

**It's important to note** that these examples do not show "The Right Way" to divide responsibilities. What's "right" depends on your team's circumstances.  
The final division of labour will likely be imperfect. The value is in aligning, to build momentum, and in having a zeitgeist you can revisit and iterate on.

## A) The expectation of roles when delivering a new feature

We draft a high-level product development life cycle.

## B) The expectation of roles when maintaining an existing feature

We draft a high-level feature life cycle.

## C) Responsibilities in the career development of a junior

We draft a high-level flow of the core tasks to get them to the next level.
