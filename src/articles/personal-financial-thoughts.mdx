## Concepts

**Salary ratio**

- _salary ratio_ = _old salary_ / _new salary_
- When changing jobs, your salary ratio between previous and new jobs shows your difference in buying-power.
- Can be more useful than exchange rate when relocating to another country to get a sense for how expensive things are.
- Use alongside exchange rate and cost-of-living to get a sense for how a job in a new country will affect your buying-power.

**Real estate**

- The house you are living in is not an asset.
- Houses you own and are not yet fully paid are not assets.
- Rental income for houses that are _not_ yet fully paid is _not_ profit. It is a reduction on your mortgage payments.
- Rental income for houses that _are_ fully paid is not _necessarily_ profit. It is first a cover for maintenance.
- Better to buy than to rent (for the same property) in the long term.
- Better not to buy than to buy in the wrong location at the wrong time.
- Tension between the above two should guide when/where/how you buy.
- You get out what you put in; requires local knowledge, continuous attention, maintenance and re-investment.
- No one cares more about your investments than you.
- Water is the enemy. Insist on the highest standards for work that deals with it.
