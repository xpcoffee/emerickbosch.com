This is a conceptual breakdown for thinking through the maturity of our systems with respect to **operations**.

# Problem

When owning systems, we often need to plan work to make them cheaper and more reliable to maintain.
We often know that this work needs to be done, but I've previously found it difficult to determine how to go about planning this work so that we can prioritise and add it to our roadmap.

It would be useful to have a systematic approach to determine the current operational state of our systems, and to think about how we can evolve them.

# Glossary

- **operations** - the work needed to keep a system healthy while doing what _it is currently doing_ at _its current scale_.
- **scaling** - the work needed to enable the system to perform what _it is currently doing_ at _a larger scale_. For this we think big; 2x,5x,10x, or 100x the current load.
- **features** - the work needed to _add new capabilites_ to the system.

In this article we are specifically looking at maturity of **operations**.

I added definitions for scalability and features to clarify what operations is _not_.
With respect to the maturity of scalability and feature work, each requires different approaches which are beyond the scope of this article.

# Operational capabilities

Operating systems is the act of keeping its current state healthy.
We can think of this as the act of detecting issues with our systems and then mitigating them.

Conceptually this means we need 3 core abilities in our system:

1. **Detecting problems**
1. **Diagnosing the root causes**
1. **Mitigating impact**

From these I find it useful to further break up detection and mitigation,
giving us 5 "axes" that we can invest in to make operations more effective, cheaper, more reliable and scalable:

1. **Detecting problems in production**
1. **Detecting problems before they reach production**
1. **Diagnosing the root causes of our problems**
1. **Mitigating impact by reverting to a previously-known stable state**
1. **Mitigating impact by mutating the system**

For each of these axes, we can define levels of maturity which can be reached by developing operational capabilities and processes.

# Detecting problems in production

Investing in this axis reduces the time and effort needed to detect issues and
increases the signal-to-noise ratio of health signals.
