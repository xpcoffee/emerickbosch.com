## Concepts

**Salary ratio**
* *salary ratio* = *old salary* / *new salary*
* When changing jobs, your salary ratio between previous and new jobs shows your difference in buying-power.
* Can be more useful than exchange rate when relocating to another country to get a sense for how expensive things are.
* Use alongside exchange rate and cost-of-living to get a sense for how a job in a new country will affect your buying-power.

**Real estate**
* The house you're living in is not an asset.
* Houses you own and are not yet fully paid are not assets.
* Rental income for houses that are *not* yet fully paid is *not* profit. It is a reduction on your mortgage payments.
* Rental income for houses that *are* fully paid is not *necessarily* profit. It is first a cover for maintenance.
* Better to buy than to rent (for the same property) in the long term.
* Better not to buy than to buy in the wrong location at the wrong time.
* Tension between the above two should guide when/where/how you buy.
* You get out what you put in; requires local knowledge, continuous attention, maintenance and re-investment.
* No one cares more about your investments than you.
* Water is the enemy. Insist on the highest standards for work that deals with it.
