This is my own reference-sheet for patterns. The aim is to make my own vocabulary explicit to align with others and to enhance my knowledge over-time.

# Why care?

Patterns are ways of organizing/architecting code or logical systems that have proven useful at solving _specific_ problems. They are useful for multiple reasons:

1. They introduce you to the existence of certain types of problems; you don't need to go through the pain of dicovering them for yourself.
1. You don't need to solve these problems from scratch. Even if a pattern doesn't fit your use-case perfectly, it can give you a strong head-start in solving your problem.
1. They give you a vocabulary to use when speaking to other developers about high-level concepts. Not needing to talk through low-level details can save _a lot_ of time during design discussions and reviews.
1. They apply outside of code. These are ways to organize logical systems; you can apply patterns to any logically organized system e.g. companies/organizations, production lines, your workflow at home.
