This is a (hopefully growing) of mechanisms that are cheap to practically implement, but that empower processes
that add value to the team and our customers.

## Innovation

These mechanisms have, as a primary (though not necessarily only) goal, to promote innovation.

### Tech experiment

**What is this?**

A short-lived task aimed at gaining new information.

**When do you use it?**

When you have technical ambiguity where you are unsure about the right path forward.
OR when you have a team member that is curious to learn about/play with technology.

**Why is it useful?**

It provides space for a task that can fail, while ensuring that we extract value out of it.

**What does it look like?**

This is a template for an experiment proposal/overview. This is used to make the initial decision around
whether or not to plan the experiment.

```md
# Experiment: Foobar

## Context

How do things work now?

## Ambiguity/problem

What knowledge are we aiming to gain/what problem are we looking to solve with this experiment?

## Approach

Short description of the approach. This is not a design; that will come later.

## Out of scope

What will not be considered as part of this experiment.

## Success criteria/Metrics

How do we know whether this was successful or not?

## Owners

@someone
@anyone

## Start date

YYYY-MM-DD

## End date

YYYY-MM-DD

This is a hard cutoff. On this date we make a decision around failure/success and whether to invest further.

## Conclusions/learnings

To be written after the experiment to summaries the outcomes. Link to more detailed artifacts here (designs, data, code, etc).
```

## Knowledge sharing

These mechanisms have, as a primary (though not necessarily only) goal, to enable knowledge sharing that scales across time and people.

### Logs

#### Operational event log

**What is this?**

Team-specific log of start/end of significant operational events. Most recent entries at the top.

**When do you use it?**

After every event concludes or after investigations.

**Why is this useful?**

Can be referenced by other teams during their reviews. Can be ingested into dashboards to auto-generate annotations. Can
be processed for insights (recurring issues; average time to mitigation).

**What does it look like?**

```md
# Operational events

2021-08-30T10:14Z | home page latency increase | end | _ticket link_ | full recovery
2021-08-30T10:13Z | home page latency increase | state-change | _ticket link_ | partial recovery
2021-08-30T10:11Z | home page latency increase | start | _ticket link_ | alarm fires
2021-08-29T12:00Z | failover data migration | end | _ticket link_ | workflow successful
2021-08-29T09:31Z | failover data migration | start | _ticket link_ | workflow started
```

#### Operational review journal

**What is this?**

Team-specific journal of a periodic operational review.

**When do you use it?**

Every operational review session.

**Why is it useful?**

Record of the review for tracking, knowledge-sharing, reference and long-term trend analysis.

```md
# YYYY-MM-DD Ops review

## What experiences do we own/maintain?

_This section shouldn't change often and is more to allow sharing._
