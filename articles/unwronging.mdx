In the long term, we want to make more right decisions than wrong ones.

In practice, we are not perfect in our understanding, in our skills, and in the data we have.
So we will make mistakes, and we will have incorrect assumptions - we are guaranteed to be wrong, sometimes.

So what we need to get good at is "unwronging":
 - Catch errors early so that they can be corrected.
 - Strive to learn how we make errors so that we can avoid them entirely in future.
 - Create an environment that promotes the above.

In addition, we shouldn't forget about successes:
 - Celebrate when we are correct. Make it feel good.
 - Strive to understand how we can be correct, faster/cheaper.

The bet is that these behaviours, over time, will allow lessons to compound and result in being right more often.
Currently I think that this is how we can systematically builds up wisdom.
