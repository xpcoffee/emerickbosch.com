<h2>Personal tenets</h2>
<div>
    <p class="grey-text">This set of tenets helps me be a kinder, more productive, happier person. They're aimed at my personal strengths and weaknesses; I don't expect others to follow similar ones as they definitely won't work for everyone.Â Like any set of tenets, these will change and get updated as I grow. </p>
    <ol class="thin-width">
        <li>Team success is individual success. <br><span class="subtext">We can't achieve our goals alone, so don't let others fail in their tasks. Be an owner of your team's goals not just your individual tasks.</span></li>
        <li>Start with the assumption that you are wrong. <br><span class="subtext">For any ambiguous situation your first though is likely incomplete or incorrect. Strive to keep yourself honest from the start.</span></li>
        <li>Don't be a dick; assume others have good intentions. <br><span class="subtext">We're on the same team and we're all trying to delight customers. Frame your perspective to one where you're looking to work with them, not against/through/around them.</span></li>
        <li>Externalize. <br><span class="subtext">Saying something is more valuable than keeping quiet. You may be the only one that thought of it. Someone else may not raise the point you want to talk about. If you're uncomfortable with a decision / in a bad mood / disappointed, raise it.</span></li>
        <li>Ask, don't tell. <br><span class="subtext">Telling people about the way things are/should be can end a conversation prematurely, especially if you have some convincing reasons for having that position. This can take agency away from others who may have stepped up. It also cuts off an opportunity for you to have heard other opinions, which may have influenced your position for the better. Asking questions can allow you to raise your thoughts without imposing them on others.</span></li>
